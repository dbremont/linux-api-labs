# Linux API'S Labs

> This project is a deep dive into the Linux platform, focusing on mastering its subsystems to develop more efficient, secure, and scalable applications. By exploring key components such as process management, memory handling, networking, and device interfaces, the goal is to gain a comprehensive understanding of Linux’s inner workings.

> Through hands-on experimentation, debugging, and optimization, this project will lay the foundation for building more robust applications that seamlessly integrate with the Linux ecosystem. Whether working with system calls, kernel modules, or user-space utilities, the objective is to enhance both performance and stability while leveraging Linux’s full potential.
