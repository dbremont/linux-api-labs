# **Networking Labs 🚀**  

> Hands-on labs to explore and deepen your understanding of Linux networking. These exercises will cover packet analysis, network stack exploration, and practical debugging techniques.  

## **Lab 1: Packet Capture with `tcpdump` 🕵️‍♂️**  

- Learn how to capture and analyze network traffic using `tcpdump`.  
- Filter packets by IP, port, or protocol.  
- Save captured packets to a `.pcap` file for offline analysis.  

## **Lab 2: Parsing PCAP Files with Python 🐍**  

- Use Python libraries (`scapy`, `pyshark`, `dpkt`) to read and analyze PCAP files.  
- Extract IP addresses, ports, and payload data.  
- Automate network traffic analysis with scripts.  

## **Lab 3: Exploring the Linux Network Stack 🏗️**

- Trace the journey of a packet through the Linux kernel.  
- Understand `sk_buff`, Netfilter, and socket APIs.  
- Modify packet processing with eBPF and Netfilter hooks.  

## **Lab 4: Creating a Virtual Network with `iproute2` 🌐**

- Use `ip link`, `ip addr`, and `ip route` to create and configure virtual interfaces.  
- Set up a simple virtual LAN (VLAN).  
- Analyze packet flow between virtual machines or containers.  

## **Lab 5: Debugging Network Issues with `ss` and `netstat` 🛠️**

- Monitor active network connections.  
- Detect dropped packets and socket states.  
- Compare `ss`, `netstat`, and `lsof` for network debugging.
